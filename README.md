# Simple-Secured-Container
Demonstrate how to secure any web content through a reverse proxy container

This solution we demontrate here is composed of three components :
  - A container Engine (In this case Docker)
  
  - A simple (unsecured) containerized Web site that host confidential content
  
  - A reverse proxy container that will:
      - Handle End-Users connexions over SSL, 
      - Authenticate them,
      - Redirect a sub-segment of a requested URL to the specific confidential Web Site
      
Here is the diagram of the solution:

# Deployment instructions
 
 ## 1. Build the confidential content image
 
 This simple docker image is based on Nginx a light Web Server Easily conterizable.
 The source image is locate in the "web" folder.
 Simply build the image by by going to the root folder of the solution and type :
 > *docker build -t web web*

 ## 2. Build the reverse proxy image
 
 Again, we will create an Nginx based image, as Nginx has also proxy/reverse proxy capabilities.
 The source image is locate in the "proxy" folder.
 Simply build the image by going to the root folder of the solution and type :
 > *docker build -t proxy proxy*

 ## 3. Deploy the solution using Docker-compose
 
To deploy the solution, go to the root folder of the solution and type :
> *docker-compose up -d*

The solution is now running on the local docker machine and be accessible at https://localhost and the secret content at https://localhost/uj47G/. 
 
# How it works

## Web image
 
The docker file describing the image contains :
  - the reference to the official Nginx:latest image
  - a integration of the welcome page (confidential content) a the default home page

As we did not make any change to the Nginx configuration, the server will listen on port 80 and use the default home page (./usr/share/nginx/html) 
 
     
## Proxy image
 
  The docker file describing the image contains :
  - the reference to the official Nginx:latest image
  - a bunch of file integration mostly for Nginx configuration:
    - ./etc/nginx/sites-enabled/proxy.conf
    - ./etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf 
    - ./etc/ssl/certs/localhost.crt
    - ./etc/ssl/private/localhost.key
    - ./etc/nginx/.htpasswd
 
 To fulfill the solution requirements, the configuration of the image goes through several steps:
 
 **1 Obtain ssl Certificate and key**
 
 In this example we will use self signed certificate, but for production pupose you must use a certificate comming from a trusted certification auhtority.
 
This blog post is a excellent source I used to create the cert/key pair : https://www.humankode.com/ssl/create-a-selfsigned-certificate-for-nginx-in-5-minutes

Basically all you have to do is use openssl :
 > sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt -config localhost.conf
 
 We then obtain these 2 files we choosed to move in these folders :
    - ./etc/ssl/certs/localhost.crt
    - ./etc/ssl/private/localhost.key
 
 
 **2 Obtain .htaccess for Basic Authentication**
 
 Following this guide, we see .htpasswd from Apache Utils is used to generate a file containing encrypted user:password pairs:
 https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-http-basic-authentication/

> sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/.htpasswd user1

It then prompt you for a password then generate the .htpasswd file we use in the image.
 
 **3 Setup config files**
 
All the configuration we need will be done un the default.conf file. Please note we can also add other config files as Nginx support multiple sets of configs.

# This section is used for the default content when not redirectinc to the confidential container
# Please not we could use a seperate container to handle this, but to keep this demo simple
# We just host a distinct web instance on the same server on port 8888
```server {
    listen 8888;
    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html index.htm;
    }
}
```
# The reverse proxy conf itself
```server {
    # We listen only on ssl ports, supporting http2
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    # We listen on localhost but we could use a hostheader
    server_name localhost;
```
    # We specify here the file location of the Cert/Key pair generated by openssl
    ```ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/localhost.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/localhost.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.1 TLSv1;
```
    # We specify here the basic authentication and the .htpasswd file location
   ```auth_basic "Private Website";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
```    
    # We setup the redirection of the default content to previous server
    ```location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888;
    }
```    
    # THIS IS IT :  We setup the redirection for the specific /uj47G/ to the web 'confidential' container
    # location specify the part of the URL to serve
    ```location /uj47G/ {
        # We re-write the entire sub-content
        rewrite ^/uj47G(/.*)$ $1 break;
        # By redirecting to the external container named 'web' (in the yml composition)
        proxy_pass http://web:80;
    }
}
```
 
## docker-compose.yml structure
 
<img src="https://github.com/pierremgagnon/simple-secured-container/blob/master/dc.png" width="205">
 
The *service:* section defines the containers to include in the solution and their configuration 

``` proxy:
    container_name: runningproxy
    hostname: proxy
    image: proxy
    ports:
      - 443:443
    networks:
      - backend
      - frontend
```
This container will run proxy image, use proxy hostname, expose only ssl port 443 and be connected to backend and frontend networks

``` web:
    container_name: runningweb
    hostname: web
    image: web
    networks:
      - backend
```
This container will run web image, use web hostname (used in previous reverse proxy config), will only be connected to the backend networks and will not expose any port to the outside. 
Indeed we secure network protocols by having internal proxy->web communication occuring internally and on a dedicated docker network.

Theses networks defined in this section:      
```networks:
  frontend:
  backend:
```
