# Simple-Secured-Container
Demonstrate how to secure any web content through a reverse proxy container

This solution we demontrate here is composed of three components :
  - A container Engine (In this case Docker)
  
  - A simple (unsecured) containerized Web site that host confidential content
  
  - A reverse proxy container that will:
      - Handle End-Users connexions over SSL, 
      - Authenticate them,
      - Redirect a sub-segment of a requested URL to the specific confidential Web Site
